# Chunk Loading Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations implemented to fix chunk pop-in issues and improve chunk loading performance.

## Problem Analysis

The original system suffered from chunk pop-in where chunks weren't being requested or created/sent fast enough as the player moved. Key issues identified:

1. **Limited concurrent requests**: Only 4 pending chunks allowed
2. **Reactive chunk loading**: Chunks only requested when player moved into new chunk area
3. **No predictive loading**: No anticipation of player movement direction
4. **Throttled chunk checks**: 100ms throttle on chunk updates
5. **No server-side caching**: Chunks regenerated unnecessarily

## Client-Side Optimizations

### 1. Increased Concurrent Requests
- **Before**: `MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS = 4`
- **After**: `MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS = 12`
- **Impact**: Allows more chunks to be requested simultaneously

### 2. Expanded Chunk Buffer
- **Before**: `CHUNK_BUFFER = 1`
- **After**: `CHUNK_BUFFER = 2`
- **Impact**: Loads chunks further from visible area for smoother experience

### 3. Predictive Chunk Loading
- **New Feature**: Added movement tracking and velocity prediction
- **Implementation**: 
  - Tracks last 10 movement vectors
  - Predicts player position 30 frames ahead
  - Requests chunks around predicted position
- **Impact**: Chunks are loaded before player reaches them

### 4. Improved Chunk Prioritization
- **New Feature**: Smart chunk request ordering
- **Implementation**:
  - Visible chunks prioritized over predictive chunks
  - Within categories, chunks sorted by distance from player
- **Impact**: Most important chunks load first

### 5. Reduced Throttling
- **Before**: 100ms throttle on chunk checks
- **After**: 50ms throttle
- **Condition**: Changed from `pendingChunks.size === 0` to `pendingChunks.size < MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS`
- **Impact**: More responsive chunk loading

### 6. Continuous Chunk Checking
- **New Feature**: Added `checkPendingChunks()` call in every frame update
- **Impact**: Ensures chunk requests are sent as soon as slots become available

## Server-Side Optimizations

### 1. Memory Cache Implementation
- **New Feature**: In-memory chunk cache with LRU eviction
- **Configuration**: 1000 chunk cache limit
- **Impact**: Eliminates regeneration of recently accessed chunks

### 2. Improved Cache Hierarchy
- **Implementation**:
  1. Check memory cache first (fastest)
  2. Check database if not in memory
  3. Generate using worker thread if not in database
- **Impact**: Significantly faster chunk retrieval for cached chunks

### 3. Reduced Worker Timeout
- **Before**: 30 second timeout
- **After**: 10 second timeout
- **Impact**: Faster failure detection and retry

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:
1. **Reduced Pop-in**: Predictive loading should eliminate most visible chunk pop-in
2. **Faster Response**: Memory cache provides near-instant chunk delivery for cached chunks
3. **Better Throughput**: Increased concurrent requests handle burst loading better
4. **Smoother Movement**: Larger buffer and predictive loading create seamless experience

### Memory Usage:
- **Client**: Minimal increase due to movement history tracking (10 vectors)
- **Server**: ~1000 chunks cached in memory (estimated 50-100MB depending on chunk size)

## Configuration Constants

### Client (`GameLogic.ts`):
```typescript
export const CHUNK_BUFFER: number = 2;
export const MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS: number = 12;
export const PREDICTIVE_BUFFER: number = 3;
```

### Server (`Server.ts`):
```typescript
const WORKER_POOL_SIZE = 16;
const CACHE_SIZE_LIMIT = 1000;
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

The system includes debug logging that shows:
- Number of loaded chunks
- Number of pending chunk requests
- Graphics objects in memory
- Connected players

Monitor these metrics to ensure the optimizations are working effectively.

## Future Optimizations

Potential additional improvements:
1. **Chunk Compression**: Further reduce network payload
2. **Batch Requests**: Send multiple chunk requests in single message
3. **Client-Side Caching**: Cache chunks on client to avoid re-downloading
4. **Adaptive Buffer**: Adjust buffer size based on player movement speed
5. **Background Generation**: Pre-generate chunks around active areas
